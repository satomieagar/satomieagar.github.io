        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Satomi Eagar. I was born in Kagoshima, Japan and raised in
          Nagasaki and Okinawa. I'm a mother of three wonderful children. The
          oldest is 27 years old, recently graduated from PA school and passed
          PA licensing board last month! My second daughter is 25 years old, and
          she graduated from Japanese University, and she's now working for a
          Japanese company. My youngest one is 20 years old. He's currently
          living with me in Japan. My husband is a retired Marine. Thanks to my
          husband, I have lived in many different places and had many wonderful
          experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason I'm taking this course is to gain a solid foundation in web
          design and development. Though I'm not planning to make it a career,
          but I'd like to keep learning new skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have taken a basic HTML and CSS course at Mesa College. Since I
          didn't practice what I learned in a previous course, I forgot many
          things I had already learned. I'd like to continue practicing after
          this course to ensure I retain the knowledge acquired in this class.
        </p>
